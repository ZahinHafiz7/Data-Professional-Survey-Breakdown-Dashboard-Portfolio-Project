# Data-Professional-Survey-Breakdown-Dashboard-Portfolio-Project
This is my simple portfolio project of Data Professional Survey Breakdown dashboard using Power BI
This project involves data cleaning tasks such as removing unwanted columns, handling duplicates, and standardizing data in the Data-Professional-Survey-Breakdown dataset. The main focus is on creating a Power BI dashboard that displays key insights such as the average age of survey takers, the count of survey takers, respondents' countries, favorite programming languages, difficulty in learning data-related skills, average salary by job title, and happiness levels in terms of work/life balance and salary.
